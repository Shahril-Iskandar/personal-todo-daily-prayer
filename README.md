# personal-todo-daily-prayer
An app to track the completion time of each prayer.

As Muslims, we are required to perform the 5 daily prayers. Each prayer has a specified start and end time determined by the sun's inclination. Ideally, one performs each prayer as soon as possible. Therefore, this app was inspired to allow one to keep track of how one has been keeping up with their prayers.

App is deployed on Streamlit Cloud: https://solat-tracker.streamlit.app/
