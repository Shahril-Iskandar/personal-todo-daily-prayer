# personal-todo-daily-prayer
An app to track the completion time of each prayer.

As Muslims, we are required to perform the 5 daily prayer. Each prayer has a specified start and end time determined from the inclination of the sun. Ideally, one perform each prayer as soon as possible. Therefore, this app was inspired to allow one to keep track on how one has been keeping up with their prayers, and improve from there.
